pantheios - Install
====================

Updated:    27th September 2015


The following steps are required to install Pantheios:
 (Please see below if your project uses CMake.)

    1. Download the latest distribution of Pantheios, from
       http://pantheios.org/

    2. Unzip it to a directory of your choice, e.g c:\3pty\pantheios-1.0.1

    3. Define an environment variable PANTHEIOS_ROOT, whose
       value is the directory in which you unzipped
       it, e.g. PANTHEIOS_ROOT=c:\3pty\pantheios-1.0.1

    4. Download the latest distribution of STLSoft, from http://stlsoft.org/

    5. Unzip it to a directory of your choice, e.g c:\3pty\stlsoft-1.9.121

    6. Define an environment variable STLSOFT, whose value is the directory
       in which you unzipped it, e.g. STLSOFT=c:\3pty\stlsoft-1.9.121

    7. Open a command shell in the appropriate directory that matches your
       compiler:
       
       * if you're compiling with Visual C++ 7.1 then cd to build/vc71
       * if you're compiling for UNIX with GCC 4.2, then cd
         to build/gcc42.unix
       * if you're compiling for Win-x64 with Visual C++ 9, then cd
         to build/vc9.x64

    8. Build using make:

       * to build the Pantheios core libraries: "make build.libs.core"
       * to build all libraries, examples and test: "make build"
       * to build and run unit/component tests: "make test"

NOTE: Pantheios depends on the (header-only) STLSoft libraries - version
  1.9.121 or later - available from http://www.stlsoft.org/.

 CMake Users
 If your project uses CMake (https://cmake.org/) as its build tool,
 you can install Pantheios as you would any other CMake project:
 1. cd Pantheios
 2. mkdir build-cmake && cd build-cmake
 3. "cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<dir_to_install_if_wanted> .."
    or simply "cmake .." if you want to install it to the default location
    or you don't want to install it at all.
 (4. "make install")
 Installing Pantheios is not necessary for using it.

 When using Pantheios in your own project, add these rows to your CMakeLists.txt:
 find_package(Pantheios <version> REQUIRED)
 include_directories (${Pantheios_INCLUDE_DIRS})

 If you ran 'cmake' as stated above, then the location of Pantheios is
 automatically known to CMake.
 (Cached in User's home directory; ~/.cmake/packages/Pantheios/ in Unix).

 Exported library targets have 'Pantheios::' prefix.
 Specify them with e.g.:
 'target_link_libraries(<your target> Pantheios::pantheios.1.core)'
